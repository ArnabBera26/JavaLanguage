StringPool: The String Pool in Java is a special memory region inside the heap that stores string literals.
 It helps optimize memory usage and improves performance by reusing identical string objects rather than creating new ones every time.

StringBuilder: In Java, StringBuilder is a class used to create mutable sequences of characters. 
Unlike String, which is immutable (meaning every modification creates a new object),
 StringBuilder allows modifications without creating new objects, making it more efficient for frequent string manipulations.

StringBuffer: In Java, StringBuffer is a mutable sequence of characters,similar to StringBuilder. 
The primary difference is that StringBuffer is thread-safe, meaning
 it is synchronized and can be used in multi-threaded environments without unexpected behavior.

 StringTokenizer: In Java, StringTokenizer is a legacy class used to split a string into tokens based on predefined delimiters. It is part of the java.util package and provides a simple way to break a string into multiple parts.

Key Features:
    Uses default delimiters (space, tab, newline) unless specified.
    Can ignore or include delimiters as tokens.
    Less flexible than split() or Scanner, but still useful in specific cases.
