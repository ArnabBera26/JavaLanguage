Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.
 It refers to the practice of hiding internal details of a class and restricting access to its data by using access modifiers.

Key Concepts of Encapsulation
Data Hiding – Instance variables are kept private.

Getter & Setter Methods – Controlled access to data.

Access Modifiers – private, public, protected determine visibility.
