WrapperClass: A wrapper class in Java is a class that wraps a primitive data type into an object.
 Java provides built-in wrapper classes for each primitive type,
  which allows primitive values to be treated as objects when necessary.

Why Use Wrapper Classes?
    They allow primitive values to be used where objects are required (e.g., in collections like ArrayList).
    Provide utility methods for parsing, converting, and manipulating values.
    Enable autoboxing and unboxing, which helps convert between primitives and objects.
