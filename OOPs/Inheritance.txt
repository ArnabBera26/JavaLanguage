n Java, inheritance is a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class. It helps promote code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

Types of Inheritance in Java
Single Inheritance – A child class inherits from a single parent class.

Multilevel Inheritance – A class inherits from another derived class.

Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.

Hybrid Inheritance – A combination of different types (not directly supported in Java).

**Java does not suppor multiple inheritance, but we can achive this using Interface 

Code Reusability – Reduces repetition by using existing classes. 
✔ Method Overriding – Child classes can modify inherited methods. 
✔ Super Keyword – Helps access parent class properties and methods.
