In Java, polymorphism is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that allows a single interface to be used for different types. It enables one method, multiple implementations and promotes code flexibility.

Types of Polymorphism in Java
Method Overloading – Same method name, different parameters (compile-time polymorphism).

Method Overriding – A child class redefines a method from the parent class (runtime polymorphism).
