The List interface in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework and extends the Collection interface.
 It represents an ordered collection of elements, allowing duplicates and indexed access.

Key Features of List
✔ Maintains insertion order
 ✔ Allows duplicate elements
  ✔ Provides indexed access (like arrays)
   ✔ Supports dynamic resizing
